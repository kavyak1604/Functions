# Functions
A function is a set of statements that takes input, does some specific computation, and produces output.

## THEORY
Functions help us in reducing code redundancy. If functionality is performed at multiple places in software, then rather than writing the same code, again and again, we create a function and call it everywhere. This also helps in maintenance as we have to make changes in only one place if we make changes to the functionality in future.<br>
A function declaration tells the compiler about the number of parameters, data types of parameters, and returns type of function. Writing parameter names in the function declaration is optional but it is necessary to put them in the definition.<br>
User-defined functions are user/customer-defined blocks of code specially customized to reduce the complexity of big programs. They are also commonly known as “tailor-made functions” which are built only to satisfy the condition in which the user is facing issues meanwhile reducing the complexity of the whole program.<br>
Library functions are also called “built-in Functions“. These functions are part of a compiler package that is already defined and consists of a special function with special and different meanings. Built-in Function gives us an edge as we can directly use them without defining them whereas in the user-defined function we have to declare and define a function before using them. <br>
